description: "This comparison set shows councils who have a similar emissions profile\
  \ to each other. \nThe goal is to try and draw comparisons between similar emissions\
  \ in similar circumstances. The five different categories in the BEIS dataset are\
  \ adjusted in different ways, and then councils are positioned on how different\
  \ they are to each other. \n"
