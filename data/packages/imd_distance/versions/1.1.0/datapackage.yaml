title: Local authority IMD distance
description: "The similarity between authorities is calculated by the proportion of\
  \ the population living in high deprivation (1st quintile), medium deprivation (2nd-3rd\
  \ quintile) and low deprivation (4th and 5th quintile) neighbourhoods. The population\
  \ density is also used to help distinguish between authorities with very similar\
  \ profiles of deprivation. \nThe labelling scheme is based on a composite score\
  \ for the whole local authority. The quintile labels are assigned based on lower-tier\
  \ population, and county and combined authorities are then slotted into based on\
  \ their relative score. \nThis UK-wide comparison is based on a [Composite Index\
  \ of Multiple Deprivation](https://mysociety.github.io/composite_uk_imd) system.\
